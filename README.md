# Gesture-Controlled Virtual Robot Arm using MediaPipe & OpenCV

Designed a hand-gesture-controlled 6-DOF robot simulation using MediaPipe for landmark tracking and OpenCV for real-time video processing. Gestures were interpreted and mapped to robotic joint states, allowing intuitive control of a simulated arm through Processing. The system served as a proof-of-concept for real-time human-robot interaction in quasi-static environments.
